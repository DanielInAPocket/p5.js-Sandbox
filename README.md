p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! (c) [p5js.org](https://p5js.org/)

### History
Back in 2016 when I only started my software developer path as an iOS developer I was curious to try other things. I was consuming a lot of content that was coding related. And one day I came accross [TheCodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) YouTube channel. First video that I have watched was about [Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) published in 2015. Since that day I became a regular viewer of TheCodingTrain channel and Game Of Life became the topic I am still curious about, but know too little of.

Even though my iOS developer job took over and became my main career path, I had fun playing around with p5.js and who knows, maybe one day I will get back to p5.js library with some new codding challenges.

### Content
